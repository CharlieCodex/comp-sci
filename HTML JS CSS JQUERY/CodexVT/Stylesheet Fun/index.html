				<h3>Video Game Developement</h3>
				<p>Why just play video games when you can create your own? Codex Academy is proud to offer an exciting camp for students who want to design video games from start to finish. Build anything from Pong to Angry Birds and run it on a computer, phone, or tablet.</p>
				<p>campers from grades 4  to 8 can join us for 1 or 2 weeks of fun and hands-on experience creating video games. All development will be done using Construct2, a powerful yet easy-to-use HTML5 toolkit for building two-dimensional (2D) games.</p>
				<p>Attendance is limited to 12 campers per week for a maximum 4 to 1 camper/counselor ratio. All software and computers will be provided by Long Trail School.</p>
				<p>Each day will be filled with instruction, hands-on programming time, and fun physical activities to maintain proper creative balance. Campers are expected to be experienced users of a Windows computer and a fan of video games in general.</p>
				<p>At the end of each week, we will host a Demo-Fest where campers show off their creations to friends and family. Games will be running on phones, tablets, and even the big screen projector. Every camper receives a full 1-year license to continue developing using Construct2 after camp ends.</p>

				<h3>Web Programming</h3>
				<p>This session will move quickly and cover a lot of ground. No prior experience is necessary but strong reading, math, computer and typing skills are important. We will be using a combination of live instruction and on-line learning provided by CodeSchool.com.  Students will receive a full 1 month subscription as part of the Codex program.</p>
				<p>If you are interested in getting a fast paced, fun introduction to being a software developer, this is the week for you. On Monday you will have a blank screen.  By Friday you will have a live interactive website built from scratch.</p>
